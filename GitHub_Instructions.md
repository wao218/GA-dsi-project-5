# Setting up and using your team GitHub repository
Authors: Jobeth Muncy & Cynthia Chiang

### Part 1 - Create your repo

1. Pick one person in your team to be the repo maintainer.
2. This person will use their __public facing GitHub account__ (not Enterprise) to create a new repo. 
3. In this repo:
   -public
   -add a .gitignore and select _python_
   -license: _creative commons_
4. Add team members
    Go to Settings->Manage Access->Invite Collaborators
  

### Part 2  - Clone the repo

1. Each team member must clone the repo (not a fork and clone, just a clone)
1. In the browser on the main page your new repo, go to __Code__ and copy the link
1. Create a new folder that is __NOT__ in your Submissions folder
1. `git clone [paste link]`
1. Check to make sure this worked using `git remote -v`

### Part 3 - Create Branches

1. Each team member (including person hosting the repo) must create their own branch
2. `git checkout -b yourname`
3. Use `git branch` to check which branch you are on. __Always work on your own branch.__

### Part 4 - Ready to work! 

1. Each person will do a `git checkout [name]` to get onto their own branch. 
2. Have each person create their own notebook and name it _yourname.ipynb_
3. Now add these notebooks to the repo:
  ```
   git add .
   git commit -m 'very informative message'
   git push origin yourname
   ```
4. Go to the browser and create a pull request. __DO NOT approve your own pull requests.__
5. The repo host will be the maintainer of the repo and approve pull requests

### Part 5 - Updating your branch 

1. When you are ready to work update your branch with changes from the main branch
     ```
     git checkout main
     git pull origin main
     git checkout yourname
     git merge main
    ```
2. Now any changes that have been made to the main branched are merged on your local branch ðŸ˜€
3. You are ready to work! Make sure you are on your own branch when you are working. When you are done:
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m 'very informative message'
    git push origin yourname
    ```
4. Create a pull request.
  You can close open issues from your pull request.
